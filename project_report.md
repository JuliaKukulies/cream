## DONE 

### classes

- class ERA5
- class Pressure 
- class Surface

### methods

- different download methods to obtain files 
- check for downloaded files in directory 
- plot surface winds 
- plot synopic environment 
- plot 2D map of any surface variable
- plot 2D map of any pressure variable 
- calculate column-integrated values from pressure levels 
- create maps with contour lines/regions 
- create vertical cross sections along latitude or longitudes 



### additional

- tested all implemented functions
- created example notebook
- documentation with doc strings 
- added package via PyPI (Python Package Index)



# Future extensions of the package could be:


## TODO 

### general extensions 
 
 - add more dataproduct classes (e.g. other climate reanalyses or gridded observation datasets)
 - add utilities to information from different datasets 
 - sphynx documentation 
 

 
### methods
